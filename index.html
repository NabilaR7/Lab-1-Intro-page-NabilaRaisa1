    <!--Write a self-bio in a paragraph-->
    <p> My name is Nabila Raisa. I am a student at Thomas A. Edison HS. I am a 10th grader, which makes me a sophomore. I turned 15 on August 26th. I am a Web Development Candidate. Web Design class is super important because I plan to take coding in college. I want to be able to make my own websites about anything I want. If I work hard enough I know I can get into Computer Science major. I enjoy this class because the students are friendly and are always willing to help me. This makes me motivated and finish all of my work in class.</p>
